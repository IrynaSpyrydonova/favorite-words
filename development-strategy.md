# Project Development Strategy

##  `Favorite-Words`

### Description

This is a collaborative HTML, CSS and JavaScript project. It consists of single dynamic webpage and 7 JS functions with the appropriate handlers and 1 script with the global variable.  

It could be useful to boost team-developing skills, to practice JavaScript, HTML and CSS3 frameworks and to get used to and practice reverse engineering.  

It could be used as a set of easy to understand pure JavaScript examples.

> For this project we use an incremental development pattern, according to which each issue (UI or JS function) was developed in its own Git branch, reviewed and then added to the main project.
